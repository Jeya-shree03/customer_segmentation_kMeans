 # Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Description
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase behavior.

## Dataset
- Name: Mall_Customers.csv  
- Source: Kaggle  
- Features used:
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1-100)

## Algorithm Used
- K-Means Clustering

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Involved
1. Load the customer dataset
2. Select relevant numerical features
3. Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
4. Apply K-Means clustering
5. Visualize customer segments

## Result
Customers are grouped into different clusters based on income and spending behavior.  
This helps businesses understand customer patterns and plan targeted marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
K-Means clustering is an effective method for customer segmentation and business decision making.
